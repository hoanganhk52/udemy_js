# 01.Execution Contexts and lexical Environments

#### Conceptual aside

- syntax parsers:

  - A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid
    > your code isn't magic. Someone else wrote a program to translate it for the computer
  - Is a part of compiler

- Lexical environment: where something sits physically in the code you write (where it's written and what surrounds it)

  > 'Lexical' means 'having to do with words or grammar'. A lexical environment exists in programming languages in which where you write something is important.

- Execution context: A wrapper to help manage the code that is running

  > There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is mamaged via execution contexts. It can contain things beyond what you're written in your code

- Object: A collection of name/value pairs
- undefined: special value that is also a special keyword in JavaScript, it's the value that variables receive during the creation phase.
- Operators: A special function that is syntactically (written) differently
- coercion: converting a value from one type to another
  - example: 1 + '2' = '12'

#### The global environment and The global object

- Execution Context (Global)
  - Whenever code is run in Js, it's run inside an execution context
  - JS engine create Global object and "this"

#### The Execution context - Creation and Hoisting

- The execution context is created in two phases
  - The creation phase: global object, this, outer environment, the parser run through the code and sets up the memory space for variables and functions. it mean before code begins to executed line by line, the JS engine has already set aside memory space for variables and functions in all of code ( variable = undefined )
  - The execution phase:

#### Functions, Context and variables environments

- variable environment: where the variables live and how they relate to each other in memory

#### The scope chain

- every execution context has a reference to its outer environment what depends on its lexical en vironment

#### Scope, ES6 and let

- Scope: where a variavle is available in your code

#### Asynchronous Callback

- Asynchronous: more than one at a time

# 02. Types and Operators

#### Primitive types: something that isn't an object

- undefined: you shouldn't set a variable to this
- null: something doesn't exist, you can set a variable to this
- boolean
- number
- string
- symbol

#### Operator Precedence and Associativity(quyen uu tien va ket hop)

- operator precedence: functions art called in order of precedence (HIGHER precedence wins)
- Associativity: what order operator functions get called in: left-to-right or right-to-left. Whwn functions have the same precedence - [refs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)
