# Big word alert

### namespace: a container for variable and functions

- typically to keep variables and functions with the same name separate

### first class function

- everything you can do with other types you can do with functions
- assign them to variables, pass them around, create them on the fly

### expression

- A unit of code that results in a value
- it doesn't have to save to a variable

### mutate

- to change something
- "immutable" means it cant be changed

### Arguments

- The parameters you pass to a function
- JS gives you a keyword of the same name which contains them all

### Whitespace

- Invisible characters that create literal 'space' in your written code
- Like: carriage returns, tabs, spaces

### Callback function

- A function you give to another function, to be run when the other function is finished

### Inheritance: one object gets access to the properties and methods of another object

### reflection

- an object can look at itself, listing and changing its properties and methods

### function constructors

- a normal function that is used to construct objects
- the "this" variable points a new empty object, and the object is returned from the function atomatically
